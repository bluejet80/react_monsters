# Monster Rolodex

This is the app that I created when I was going through the React Basics Section of the Udemy react Course.

[React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/29209638)

# First thing

The first thing we did was run the npm command

    npx create-react-app monster-rolodex

This installed the correct files and folders to get the app started.

Then I ran

    npm start

To start the development server.
